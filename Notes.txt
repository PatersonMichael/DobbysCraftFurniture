Need to add:
1. Cart
    i. cart visuals
        a. offscreen popup on click
        b. display list of items: ITEM NAME:        $PRICE
        c. cart items counter
        d. checkout function: Checkout Button, subtotal, tax, total
        e. Quantity button
        f. Delete button
    ii. cart functionality
        a. when "Add to Cart" is clicked, adds data from target to a new item, populates cart.
            1. creates instance of "Grocery Item" class (see below)
            2. adds item to cart display
            3. adds item price to subtotal
            4. adds item to cart's local storage
        b. displays subtotal, tax, total
            1. subtotal = sum of prices of all items in cart
            2. tax: CA sales tax = 0.0725
            3. total = subtotal + (subotal * tax)
        c. Quantity button
            1. Quantity multiplies the number of instances of that item
            2. In a fuller app, would tell the business the specific quantity of that item needed to be pulled from inventory and shipped. For now: only multiply item price by quantity for subotal calculation.
        d. Delete button
            1. Removes that item from the cart
                a. delete the instance of the grocery item
                b. subtract the item's price from subtotal.
                c. removes the item from cart's local storage

            5. add to cart button
    ii. Grocery item functionality
        a. create a class for "grocery items"

                i. Item name = data from target's card-title
                ii. Item price = data from target's card-price
